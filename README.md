## 📖 - Description
I have made this app yesterday's evening in about a hour and half to understand what was the life of a developer before the release of Swift, so I've opened Xcode 4.6 on my 2006 Mac Mini and, wow. 
Xocde 4.6 is the last version supportend by the Mac and it contains the iOS 6.1 SDK, with a beautiful iPhone 4-style simulator.
This app is really simple, you can add items in a TableView (also adding items from the clipboard) an when you click once of them the app saves the selected aitem in the clipboard, so it's a clip collection I suppose 😅.
